                <p class="intro__text">According to&nbsp;VTsIOM polls, 95% of&nbsp;Russians dream of&nbsp;going somewhere, but only&nbsp;36% plan to&nbsp;spend their holidays in&nbsp;their home country. Like, what have we&nbsp;not seen here at&nbsp;home? In&nbsp;fact, Russia is&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole universe with the gentle sea of ​​the south, the dense forests of&nbsp;the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of&nbsp;the Putorana Plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions on&nbsp;your account, a&nbsp;passport and many hours of&nbsp;flights. As, for example, Vera Bashmakova&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;brave young mother who took three children in&nbsp;her arms, put them in&nbsp;her &laquo;Lada&raquo; and drove 20&nbsp;thousand kilometers through her native country. We&nbsp;have selected and described some interesting places worthy of&nbsp;your vacation.</p>

                            Primarily because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes covered with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places - the mountain air.</p>
                            
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is best to go here in summer. This way you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Elk roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous Pallas' cat are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

                        <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skiing competitions. This is the kind of sport where the skier straps himself
                            to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as fast as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record was set at the Baikal Mile festival - 197.011 km / h.</p>

But here it reaches 30 meters - the forests of the Karelian national parks have never known an ax because of impenetrable swamps. Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living creature that has seen the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it.
                            In the virgin forest for a hundred kilometers you will not find a trail. And on rare paths the trees
                            a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.</p>
